     <h1>About Me</h1>
     <p>Hi, my name is Paula Aidoo.</p>
     <p>Fun Fact: I was originally a Computer Graphics and Imaging major, <br>
        then I switched to Computer Science due to my desire to problem solve and  <br>
        learn a new skill that was challenging and new to me. </p>

     <h2>Familiar Programming Languages</h2>
     <p>
       Java <br>
       Python <br>
       HTML <br>
     </p>
     <h2>Philosophy</h2>
     <p>I believe engineering takes great grit and skill. Software engineering is an artmanship that at last,<br>
        grows from good understanding of user requirements and eventually provides value to its users <br>
        by delivering good software products that meets users' requirements. </p>
